# Cyclistic_Bikeshare
A capstone project for the *Google Data Analytics certificate*.
## Scenario
In this project I'm acting as a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. 
Companies Bike-share program features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure,
but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that
are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and
returned to any other station in the system anytime. flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes,
and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers
who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclisticâ€™s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders.Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno(The director of marketing) believes there is a very good chance to *convert casual riders into members*. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs. 

My Assignment is work with past data and finding how do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently
